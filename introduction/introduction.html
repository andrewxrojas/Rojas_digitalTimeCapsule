                Andrew is a multifaceted individual with a zest for life and a keen eye for design. <br> He is on a journey to hone his creative talents as he pursues a Visual Design degree <br> at San Francisco State University.

                During his precious leisure moments, Andrew's interests span a broad spectrum. <br> He's a gym enthusiast, sculpting not just his design skills but also his physique. <br> Nature beckons him, and he eagerly explores picturesque hiking trails, finding solace <br> and inspiration amidst the natural beauty. At home, he's surrounded by his beloved pets, <br> cherishing quality moments with his furry companions, forging connections that are both <br>heartwarming and enduring.

                A passionate audiophile, Andrew immerses himself in music <br> and his favorite shows, indulging in the rich tapestry of sound and storytelling. <br> His green thumb extends beyond aesthetics as he tends to his garden, nurturing life <br> and finding tranquility.

                Culinary exploration is one of Andrew's greatest joys. He's <br> an adventurous foodie, constantly seeking new and exciting dishes to savor, <br> and he enjoys sharing these gustatory delights with friends and family.

                <br> When the weather graces the Bay Area with its best, Andrew heads to scenic beaches <br> like San Gregorio Beach, Marshall Beach, and the picturesque Secret Cove in Tahoe. <br> There, he finds solace in the rhythmic sounds of the waves and the breathtaking vistas, <br> a perfect backdrop for his creative thoughts to flourish.

                Andrew's life is a canvas, filled <br> with a diverse array of colors and experiences, each stroke contributing to the masterpiece <br> that is his journey. Whether through his designs, hairstyling, or adventures, <br> Andrew seeks to make every moment meaningful and beautiful.
