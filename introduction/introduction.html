               <p>
                  Andrew is a multifaceted individual with a zest for life and a keen eye for design. He is on a journey to hone his creative talents as he pursues a Visual Design degree at San Francisco State University. 
                  Beyond the classroom, Andrew wears another hat, that of a professional hairstylist. With an innate sense of aesthetics, he transforms hair into works of art, leaving his clients looking their best and feeling their best. 
                  During his precious leisure moments, Andrew's interests span a broad spectrum. He's a gym enthusiast, sculpting not just his design skills but also his physique. Nature beckons him, and he eagerly explores picturesque hiking 
                  trails, finding solace and inspiration amidst the natural beauty.

               <p>At home, he's surrounded by his beloved pets, cherishing quality moments with his furry companions, forging connections that are both heartwarming and enduring. A passionate audiophile, Andrew immerses himself in music and his 
                  favorite shows, indulging in the rich tapestry of sound and storytelling. His green thumb extends beyond aesthetics as he tends to his garden, nurturing life and finding tranquility. Culinary exploration is one of Andrew's 
                  greatest joys. He's an adventurous foodie, constantly seeking new and exciting dishes to savor, and he enjoys sharing these gustatory delights with friends and family. When the weather graces  the Bay Area with its best, 
                  Andrew heads to scenic beaches like San Gregorio Beach, Marshall Beach, and the picturesque Secret Cove in Tahoe. There, he finds solace in the rhythmic sounds of the waves and the breathtaking vistas, a perfect backdrop 
                  for his creative thoughts to flourish.
