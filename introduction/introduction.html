            Andrew is a multifaceted individual with a zest for life and a keen eye for design. <br> He is on a journey to hone his creative talents as he pursues a Visual Design degree <br> at San Francisco State University. 
            Beyond the classroom, Andrew wears another hat,<br> that of a professional hairstylist. With an innate sense of aesthetics, he transforms hair <br> into works of art, leaving his clients looking their best and feeling their best. <br>
            During his precious leisure moments, Andrew's interests span a broad spectrum. <br> He's a gym enthusiast, sculpting not just his design skills but also his physique. <br> Nature beckons him, and he eagerly explores picturesque hiking 
            trails, finding solace <br> and inspiration amidst the natural beauty. 
         </p>
         <p>At home, he's surrounded by his beloved pets, cherishing quality moments with his <br> furry companions, forging connections that are both heartwarming and enduring. <br> A passionate audiophile, Andrew immerses himself in music and his 
            favorite shows, <br> indulging in the rich tapestry of sound and storytelling. His green thumb extends <br> beyond aesthetics as he tends to his garden, nurturing life and finding tranquility. <br> Culinary exploration is one of Andrew's 
            greatest joys. He's an adventurous foodie, <br> constantly seeking new and exciting dishes to savor, and he enjoys sharing <br> these gustatory delights with friends and family. When the weather graces <br> the Bay Area with its best, 
            Andrew heads to scenic beaches like San Gregorio Beach, <br> Marshall Beach, and the picturesque Secret Cove in Tahoe. There, he finds solace <br> in the rhythmic sounds of the waves and the breathtaking vistas, a perfect backdrop <br> 
            for his creative thoughts to flourish. 
         </p>
         <p>Andrew's life is a canvas, filled with a diverse array of colors and experiences, each <br> stroke contributing to the masterpiece that is his journey. Whether through his designs, <br> hairstyling, or adventures, Andrew seeks to make
