### Overview
The Time Capsule Project is a website designed to showcase my digital footprint in today's world. It is a digital portfolio offering a concise introduction to myself as the author. This platform provides insights into my personal preferences, such as music and movies, and highlights the activities I enjoy during my leisure time.


### Technical Overview

To bring the Time Capsule Project to life, I employed a straightforward technical approach:

1. **Web Development Languages:** The website was constructed using HTML and CSS, ensuring a visually appealing and accessible design.

2. **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code was the primary development environment, facilitating efficient coding and debugging.

This minimalist approach allowed me to create a user-friendly and informative website that showcases my digital presence and personal interests to visitors.
